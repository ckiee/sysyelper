# sysyelper

sysyelper is a [Discord](https://discord.com) bot that intergrates with the [PluralKit](https://pluralkit.me) discord bot to automatically suggest switches for our system.

## Usage

You need to copy `.env.example` to `.env`, change the variables and then read the code to learn how it works since I'm not really expecting anyone else to use this.
