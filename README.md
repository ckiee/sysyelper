# sysyelper is now a part of daiko.

I realized it'd be more convenient to have [a monolith](https://github.com/ckiee/daiko).

**(Original README contents ahead)**

sysyelper is a [Discord](https://discord.com) bot for my personal server:

- It intergrates with the [PluralKit](https://pluralkit.me) bot to automatically suggest registering switches for our system.
- It manages ephemeral message access: you can only read message history while chatting. If you only lurk you won't be able to see older messages.
  + This is no longer enabled by default, but the code remains.

## Usage

You need to copy `.env.example` to `.env`, change the variables and then read the code to learn how it works since I'm not really expecting anyone else to use this.
